# CNNs-CIFAR-10_MNIST
Develops an image classification system for object recognition. Uses the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets as base and designs two CNNs: one original model designed by me, and a recreation of the historical AlexNet.

The file has multiple boxes, which should be run in order in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file). Here you can find a tutorial on how to run a Jupyter Notebook project https://youtu.be/r8BXJdE9ChE?si=lSu5zIOUttVggt0r, but there are plenty other tutorials on Youtube. Note that you should first clone the repository on your machine and install all the necessary libraries.
